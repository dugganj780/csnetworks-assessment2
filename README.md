Welcome to my project. It is a simple app, written in Python, utilising a Raspberry Pi and various network connections to allow a user to see the status of the weather and use this information to decision make a decision on whther or not to drive to work that day.


### How to Use
1. Boot the RPi
2. The LEDs should light up to represent the level of rainfall(top half), temperature(bottom left quarter), wind speed (bottom right quarter)
